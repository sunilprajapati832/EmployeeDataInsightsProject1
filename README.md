Unlocking Business Insights with Hypothesis Testing in Data Analysis! ðŸ“Š
In the world of data, assumptions alone wonâ€™t drive decisionsâ€”hypothesis testing is the key! Recently, while working on an employee dataset (employees.csv), I explored statistical techniques to validate patterns in salaries, bonuses, and team distributions. Hereâ€™s what I discovered:

âœ… T-Test helped compare salary differences between genders. 
 T-Test Results: t-statistic = 0.6902433639146855, p-value = 0.490251331178551
Fail to reject Hâ‚€: No significant difference in salaries by gender.

âœ… Chi-Square Test examined relationships between team (category of departments) and gender.
 Chi-Square Results: Chi2 Statistic = 4.178713499836563, p-value = 0.8992610143712624
Fail to reject Hâ‚€: No significant relationship between team and gender.
 
âœ… ANOVA revealed salary variations across different teams. 
 ANOVA Test Results: F-statistic = 0.5429222839201167, p-value = 0.8435252071606594
Fail to reject Hâ‚€: No significant difference in salaries across teams.

âœ… Correlation Analysis highlighted connections between salary and bonus percentage. 
 Correlation Results: Pearson Correlation = -0.04366458066251373, p-value = 0.22800576203696418
Fail to reject Hâ‚€: No significant correlation.

âœ… Mann-Whitney U Test addressed non-normal distributions for deeper insights.
 Mann-Whitney U Test Results: U-statistic = 75076.0, p-value = 0.47796366871621043
Fail to reject Hâ‚€: No significant difference in salaries by gender.

Hypothesis testing is an essential tool for making data-backed business decisions instead of relying on assumptions. Whether itâ€™s HR analytics, financial projections, or process optimizationâ€”these techniques help uncover hidden patterns.
